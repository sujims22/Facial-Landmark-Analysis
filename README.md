# Facial Landmark Analysis and Anomaly Detection

This project aims to perform facial landmark analysis and anomaly detection using facial landmark detection techniques. It calculates various facial angles and ratios, which can be useful for applications like medical diagnosis, cosmetic surgery planning, and facial anomaly detection.

## Dependencies
OpenCV
face_alignment

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (e.g., OpenCV and face_alignment).
2. Provide an input image path by modifying the following line in the code:

   ```python
   frame = cv2.imread('Test_images/image-1.jpeg')

## Results

The code provides measurements and ratios related to facial landmarks and angles. These results can be used for various applications and analysis of facial structures.
